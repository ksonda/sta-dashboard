# sta-dashboard
A client for SensorThings API

My goal is an easy-to-deploy and use web application that basically has the same functionality as this: https://gemstat.bafg.de/applications/public.html?publicuser=PublicUser
 
Eg., there is a web map showing locations of all stations. Stations are filterable by what parameters they have data on. When you click a station, you can select which parameters you are interested in, and visualize the results as tabular data or a line graph. You can also choose to export data form all selected parameters and stations as a CSV file. This should be able to run against any SensorThings API endpoint. Some example endpoints are here:
 
https://sta-demo.internetofwater.dev/api/v1.1
https://sta.ci.taiwan.gov.tw/STA_AirQuality_EPAIoT/v1.1
https://st.newmexicowaterdata.org/FROST-Server/v1.1
https://service.datacove.eu/AirThings/v1.1/
 
Ideally, the dashboard would be able to consume from multiple endpoints, that the user could specify, or could be configured without allowing the end user to specify.
 
This is the official documentation for the API http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html
This is some good interactive documentation for the API, focus on the GET requests https://gost1.docs.apiary.io/#
